<h2 align="left"> :memo: Something About Me  </h2>

I love Nature, Robot and Research. 
What is a possible meeting point? Autonomous systems used in the exploration of unknown environments!
I'm a Master's student in Automation and Control Engineering at Politecnico di Milano (Italy), My objective is to work on R&D in advanced control techniques for Underwater Robots. 

I believe that there are unsolved problems in different fields of science and engineering, with many similarities we don't think about. 
That's why joining forces is the only way to solve some of those.
I want to work closely with experts in biology, environmental studies, mechanics, etc..., to find the solution to those problems. <br/>
To make an example, This crazy [bio-inspired octopus robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7FEJJsvHRQ&t=0s&ab_channel=IEEESpectrum) (still in development) requires expertise on materials engineering, mechanics, computer science, marine biology, software development, Machine Learning, and so on... <br/>
Only a heterogeneous team can handle this problem, the results can be amazing!


I'm very passionate about what I do. I love learning and understanding how stuff works. <br/>
:speech_balloon: Don't hesitate to reach me if you have similar interests, I love sharing ideas !! (email or LinkedIn above)
