<h2 align="left"> :memo: Something About Me  </h2>

I love Nature (especially the ocean and its inhabitants), Robots and Research. <br/>
What is a possible meeting point? Autonomous systems deployed in unknown and endangered marine environments! <br/>
Not just for the sake of exploring, but for understanding how to develop new conservation and restoration solutions!

I'm a PhD candidate in **Underwater Robotics** at the University of Montpellier, <br/>
with the [Robotique Sous-Marine (RSM) Team](https://www.lirmm.fr/equipes/rsm/). <br/>
My ongoing PhD thesis is entitled:
*"Mapping and monitoring of the surface state and biological colonization of submerged parts of offshore wind turbines by acoustic imaging"*. <br/>

My objective is to work on **R&D in Underwater Robots perception**. I want to enhance scene understanding and system autonomy, for biodiversity, environmental, and renewable infrastructure monitoring, conservation and restoration. 

I believe that there are unsolved problems in different fields of science and engineering, with many similarities we don't think about. 
That's why **joining forces is the only way to solve some of those**.
I want to work closely with experts in biology, environmental studies, data science, electronics, and mechanics, to find the solution to those problems. <br/>


I'm very passionate about what I do. I love learning and understanding how stuff works. <br/>
:speech_balloon: Don't hesitate to reach me if you have similar interests, I love sharing ideas !! (email or LinkedIn above)

<h2 align="left"> :mortar_board: Last Research Project (MSc Thesis)  </h2> 

:blue_book: If you are curious about this project, my MSc Thesis is shared [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XxlLAqeCEWFzSnoYQ-2cF5ayQb_x5DG8?usp=drive_link)!

I worked on a multilimbed multimodal (walking-climbing-driving) robot for extreme environment exploration, in particular:
- ROS2 (Humble and Jazzy) software implementation in C++
- Motion algorithm definition and implementation
- Model identification and kinematic modeling
- [Dexterity analysis](https://github.com/AlePuglisi/limbed-robot-control) in MATLAB
- [Simulation in Gazebo](https://github.com/AlePuglisi/LIMBERO) (Classic and Harmonic)
- Real system experiments

This project started as a researcher at the Space Robotics Lab (SRL, Tohoku University) and than completed as Master Student at Politecnico di Milano. <br/>
